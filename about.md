#Blogging like a programmer
Blogging tools are normally bloated and power demanding as well as web-administrated. This talk will step by step show how amazing and simple it can be to create and write to a powerful and lightweight blog. We will look at [a blogging platform](http://jekyllrb.com/) that allows you to write post locally and push changes to your server when you are ready. Blog post can be written with [a simple and beautiful format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), easily [themed and templated](http://getpoole.com/) using web-standards. On top of this you blog can be backuped with your [favorite version control system](http://git-scm.com/) and [freely hosted](https://pages.github.com).
